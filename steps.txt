1. Write an db_export management function that outputs data in same format as legacy gas tracker

2. Get mysql working on my machine

3. Test my export import logic with new mysql logic

4. If it works, create an RDS mysql free tier db and give it a public IP

5. Run my export/import again, this time pointing to the RDS db. Ensure it worked

6. If it works, make permanent changes to Django db settings to point to RDS for production
    - CHANGE database from publicly available to private only
    - use the private endpoint in my production settings
